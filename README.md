# Python-Pandas-School-Analysis

## Overview

As the new Chief Data Scientist for the city's school district, this analysis was conducted to provide strategic insights regarding school performance and standardized test results across the district. The key objectives were to summarize district performance metrics, identify trends in school performance, and analyze school performance based on different categories such as spending per student, school size, and school type.

## Summary of Analysis

### District Summary
- **Total Schools:** 15
- **Total Students:** 39,170
- **Total Budget:** $24,649,428
- **Average Math Score:** 78.99
- **Average Reading Score:** 81.88
- **% Passing Math:** 74.98%
- **% Passing Reading:** 85.81%
- **% Overall Passing:** 80.39%

### School Performance
- **Charter Schools vs. District Schools:** Charter schools generally outperform district schools in terms of average test scores and passing rates.
- **Impact of School Size:** Smaller schools (less than 1000 students) tend to have better performance metrics compared to larger schools.

## Key Findings

1. **Impact of School Type on Performance:**
   - Charter schools show significantly better performance compared to district schools. The average math score in charter schools is higher, and the percentage of students passing math is also greater. This trend is consistent across reading scores and overall passing rates. This indicates that the learning environment or instructional methods in charter schools might be more effective in preparing students for standardized tests.

2. **Influence of School Size on Student Performance:**
   - Smaller schools tend to have better academic performance compared to medium and large schools. This can be attributed to more individualized attention to students, better student-to-teacher ratios, and possibly more engaged communities. The data reveals that small schools have higher average math and reading scores, as well as a greater percentage of students passing both subjects.

## Conclusions

The insights from this analysis provide valuable information for the school board and the mayor to make informed decisions regarding resource allocation, school policies, and future budgeting priorities. By focusing on the factors that contribute to higher student performance, such as supporting charter schools and maintaining smaller school sizes, the district can enhance overall student success and educational outcomes.
